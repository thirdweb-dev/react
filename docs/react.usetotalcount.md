## Remarks

The `total count` and `total supply` are the same for  based contracts. For  the `total count` is the number of NFTs that exist on the contract, \*\*not\*\* the sum of all supply of each token. (Since ERC1155 can have multiple owners per token.)

const nftDrop = useNFTDrop(<ContractAddress>);
const { data: totalCount, isLoading, error } = useTotalCount(nftDrop);
```

## Example 2


```javascript
const { contract } = useContract(<ContractAddress>);
const { data: totalCount, isLoading, error } = useTotalCount(contract?.nft);
```
