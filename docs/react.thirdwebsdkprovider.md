## ThirdwebSDKProvider variable

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

A barebones wrapper around the Thirdweb SDK.

You can use this in order to be able to pass a provider &amp; signer directly to the SDK.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
ThirdwebSDKProvider: React.FC<React.PropsWithChildren<ThirdwebSDKProviderProps>>
```

## Remarks

Utilizing this provider will mean hooks for wallet management are not available, if you need those please use the [ThirdwebProvider](./react.thirdwebprovider.md) instead.
